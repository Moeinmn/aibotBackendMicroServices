Back when he was working at Google as a data scientist, Dr. Masoud Farivar, Caltech Ph.D. holder and PlotSet CEO, became inspired to create a system that would make converting big data into short video presentations. He started out doing it just as a hobby, but after a while decided he could turn it into a service anyone can use. Gathering the best and brightest people around him, he created a team to bring his vision to life. We are now a team of data enthusiasts obsessed with visually beautiful stories, and we have developed PlotSet to ensure that our users meet their audience's needs.
